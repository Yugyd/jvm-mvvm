JVM MVVM
========

Architecture for Android applications in Kotlin using the MVVM pattern.**

- **Structured**, uses the UDF (Unidirectional Data Flow) approach
- **Modern**, Jetpack Compose–friendly
- **Testable and predictable**: everything is built around State and the JVM, with minimal Android
  dependencies
- **Delegation-friendly**: solves the problem of oversized ViewModels
- **Simple**: minimal code required for implementation and a basic tech stack
- **Performant**: most of the code runs on the JVM without Android dependencies, and modules build
  faster

## Stack
